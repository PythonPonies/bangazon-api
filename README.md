# Bangazon README

Bangazon is a mock company that's taking over the e-commerce world. We aim to allow anyone to sell goods to other people. This is a group project for [http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/](Nashville Software School).

Currently, Bangazon provides an API. It will be populated with more data in the future. It is built using the Django Rest Framework.

## Installation Instructions
1. Run `git clone git@github.com:PythonPonies/bangazon-api.git` in a folder where you'd like to keep this project.
1. Run `cd bangazon-api/bangazon` to navigate into the created directory.
1. Run `python manage.py migrate` to build the needed database.
1. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django server.
1. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view the API resources.

## How to Use The API
Follow the steps above to run this app locally. Since this is a RESTful API, you can go to the root URL ([http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)) to see all resources available and which methods can be used on each resource.
