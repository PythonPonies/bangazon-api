###Expectations of Work

####Definition of Done

There is a very clear Definition of Done that you must adhere to. If you do not, your manager will not approve the project for deployment.

1. The project must be fully documented. This includes the following:
2. Complete README that documents the steps to install the code, how to install any dependencies, or system configuration needed.
3. Every class must be documented with purpose, author, and methods.
4. Every method must be documentation with purpose and argument list - which itself must contain a short purpose for each argument.
5. The project must be able to run fully, and without errors, on each teammate's system.
6. Fulfills every requirement.
7. Every line of code has been peer reviewed.
8. For projects that require unit testing, core functionality must be identified and have at least one test for each.
